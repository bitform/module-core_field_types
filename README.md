## Core Field Types

> As of Form Tools 3.0.0, this code has been pulled into the [Form Tools Core](https://github.com/formtools/core). This repo is only of use for Form Tools 2.x versions.

This module contains all the default field types available for your forms: input fields, textareas, radios,
checkboxes, dropdowns, multi-select dropdowns, phone number fields, dates, times, and code/markup fields. It's
installed automatically for all Core installations after 2.1.5.
